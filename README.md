UIAlertController
=================
new control of iOS8.

Hi everyone, I was working of migrating my own project to ios8, there what found the UIPickerview controller with action sheet was not working properly there. Then searched and came to know that ios8 has a new control UIAlertViewController, that can be used as an alternavtive to PickervView.

This demo is generated to help my friends to get a quick and easy glance over this new Controller.

Also its my first ever demo. Need feedback and guidance to improve my self. :)

Happy coding
